## Screen shots:

## Requirements

- delete all props
- Use Context API instead
- The app should still be able to change theme by clicking on Navbar icon

## Consider this

- make a store folder/file to create the context
- try not to change variable and functions names
- wrap the parts that need the context with provider
- consume the context in the components with the correspondent hook
